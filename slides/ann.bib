@article{Siegelmann1995,
  abstract =     {This paper deals with finite size networks which
                  consist of interconnections of synchronously
                  evolving processors. Each processor updates its
                  state by applying a "sigmoidal" function to a linear
                  combination of the previous states of all units. We
                  prove that one may simulate all Turing machines by
                  such nets. In particular, one can simulate any
                  multi-stack Turing machine in real time, and there
                  is a net made up of 886 processors which computes a
                  universal partial-recursive function. Products (high
                  order nets) are not required, contrary to what had
                  been stated in the literature. Non-deterministic
                  Turing machines can be simulated by
                  non-deterministic rational nets, also in real
                  time. The simulation result has many consequences
                  regarding the decidability, or more generally the
                  complexity, of questions about recursive nets.},
